		<h2>Cape-to-Cape in South Africa</h2>
		This road trip will break your Instagram.
		<p>South Africa’s southern N2 highway from Cape Town (Western Cape) to Port Elizabeth (Eastern Cape) was designed for detours. Instead of driving straight through (about 460 miles), pull off frequently—particularly on the spectacularly scenic Garden Route section—to explore lagoons, lakes, forests, mountains, beaches, and bays. Sleep cheap at backpacker hostels like Tube ‘n Axe in Storms River. Hike in Garden Route National Park and catch a wave at world-class surf spot, Jeffreys Bay. At Mossel Bay (the halfway point on the drive) try sandboarding on 557-foot high Dragon Dune. Where the Western and Eastern Cape meet, walk out on—or, if you dare, bungee jump from—the arch of 709-foot-high Bloukrans Bridge with Face Adrenalin.</p>

		<h2>Eastern Europe by Balkan Flexipass</h2>
		The scenery on this trip is just as stunning as Switzerland's for half the price.
		<p>	For first-class vistas on a bare-bones budget, ride mainly by rail (partly by bus) from Serbia to the Adriatic coast. The original train route—completed in 1976 and undergoing its first major upgrade—dramatically winds through mountains and briefly passes through Bosnia and Herzegovina on its way from Belgrade, Serbia, to Bar, Montenegro. Due to construction, the first leg of the 10-hour (one-way) trip currently is by bus. To add more train travel, buy a Rail Europe Balkan Flexipass (starting at $108) for three, five, seven, 10, or 15 days of unlimited rides on national rail networks in Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Turkey. </p>

		<h2>Pokhara, Nepal</h2>
		Hit a travel high in the beauty of this Himalayan city.
		<p>Soaring over the Pokhara Valley delivers adrenaline-junkie Himalaya views without the hiking. Pokhara, a gateway to Nepal’s Annapurna region, is considered one of the world’s top spots for paragliding due, in part, to jaw-dropping views of glaciers, lakes, and snow-covered peaks. No experience is required to ride with an instructor on a Sunrise Paragliding tandem flight. Options include the relatively tame Cloud Buster (20- to 30-minute) scenic flight, a longer (45- to 60-minute) Cross-Country tour, and the spinning-and-spiraling Acrobatic Flight. Before launching from Sarangkot (2,000 feet above the Pokhara Valley), snap a pic of Pokhara’s majestic mountain triple crown—26,795-foot Dhaulagiri, 26,040-foot Annapurna II, and 26,781-foot Manaslu. </p>
